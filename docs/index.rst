Welcome to Palmari's documentation!
===================================

What's included ?
-----------------

Palmari is a Python package providing tools to process movies of PALM experiments (photo-activated localization microscopy). 
It provides a **customizable pipeline scheme** with the following features :

- **Get your trajectories in a few clicks** with built-in, ready-to-use processing steps : localizer, tracker, drift corrector, ... 

- **Napari widget** to adjust a pipeline's parameters : intuitively visualize the effect of one or the other parameter. 
  Want to test your results' robustness to different processing pipelines ? 
  Palmari stores the localizations and trajectories output from each pipeline so that they can be easily compared afterwards.

- Designed from the start to **process series of PALM acquisitions** using a same pipeline : 
  don't loose time writing scripts to go through all files in a folder. 
  Palmari's :py:class:`Experiment` class allows you to keep track of your entire series of acquisition and stores your processing results.  

- Easily **include your favorite processing steps** in your Palmari pipeline, see :ref:`here <own_steps>` for more details. 
  If it's worth sharing, consider a merge request ! ðŸ«µ
